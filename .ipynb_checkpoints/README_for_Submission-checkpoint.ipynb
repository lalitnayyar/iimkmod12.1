    "## 1. Influence of Trend, Seasonality, and Cycles on Retail Strategic Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend:**\n",
    "- Trends represent the long-term movement in sales data (e.g., steady increase in online purchases).\n",
    "- Example: An 8% annual growth in e-commerce sales leads to increased stock levels and warehouse expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonality:**\n",
    "- Predictable, recurring fluctuations (e.g., Diwali, Christmas, back-to-school sales).\n",
    "- Example: Clothing retailers stock up on winter apparel and run holiday promotions in Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cycles:**\n",
    "- Longer-term patterns linked to economic or industry cycles (e.g., 3-5 year tech innovation cycles).\n",
    "- Example: Adjusting spending and staffing in anticipation of economic slowdowns or booms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Impact:**\n",
    "- **Inventory Management:** Trends and seasonality inform stock replenishment, reducing overstocking/stockouts.\n",
    "- **Marketing Campaigns:** Promotions timed to seasonal/cyclical peaks maximize ROI.\n",
    "- **Operational Planning:** Staffing and logistics are aligned to demand, improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Role and Impact of Irregularities (Noise) in Retail Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Irregularities (Noise):**\n",
    "- Noise refers to random, unpredictable fluctuations in sales data.\n",
    "- If misinterpreted, noise can lead to poor decisions (e.g., overreacting to a one-time sales spike).\n",
    "- Example: Sudden umbrella sales spike due to a storm is not a trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "- Use smoothing and decomposition to separate noise from true patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Importance of Moving Average Model for Short-Term Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving averages smooth short-term fluctuations, revealing real sales patterns.\n",
    "- Helps plan inventory for seasonal peaks (e.g., holiday sales).\n",
    "- Example: 14-day moving average for toy sales in December ensures shelves stay stocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Advantages of ARIMA Models for Long-Term Retail Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARIMA models capture trend and seasonality for robust long-term forecasts.\n",
    "- Supports inventory, staffing, and resource planning.\n",
    "- Example: Supermarket chain forecasts next 12 months to optimize contracts, deliveries, and hiring.\n",

    "## Instructions for Running the Notebook and Exporting to PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Manual (Jupyter Notebook)\n",
    "1. Open `Time_Series_Retail_Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.\n",
    "2. Run all cells (`Cell > Run All`).\n",
    "3. Export as PDF (`File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Automatic Script\n",
    "1. Ensure you have Jupyter, nbconvert, and LaTeX installed.\n",
    "2. Run the provided script from the assignment folder:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python export_notebook_to_pdf.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. This will execute the notebook and generate `Time_Series_Retail_Assignment.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- If you get errors about LaTeX, install MiKTeX (Windows) or TeX Live (Linux/Mac).\n",
    "- If you get errors about notebook validity, open and run all cells in Jupyter first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
